## Overview

This was my attempt to solve the challenge from frontend mentor, this challenge was solve using React framework, it also include css styling with flexbox and relative positioning, the important part was about using the api, the get request form the api was done using axios library. From React use of React States was also made.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [axios] (https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

### What I learned

There were 2 major learning

- Use of api, this was the first time that I used an actual api, it was fun and easy.

- Learning relative position in css, it was quite challenging to figure the type of properties I would need to use but after some chatGPT it went easy.

### Continued development

I want to use tailwind to develop this project, as I am new to learnign tailwing and this project, I made myself clear with styles using normal CSS, next I will recreate this project using tailwingcss.

### Useful resources
